TODO what happens if you use list.remove(Integer.valueOf(77))?
- removes the first occurrence of the element 77

TODO also try with a LinkedList - does it make any difference?
- it makes a difference because it would be faster for things like removing.

which of the two lists performs better as the size increases?
- as size increases we would see LinkedList doing better performance wise.
